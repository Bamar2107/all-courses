the sceen sizes are

1. Extra Large = xl
2. Large = lg
3. Medium = md
4. Small = sm 
5. Extra Small = for extra small there will be no symbol

like for padding. there will be different screen size

These screen size ranges from 0 to 5 
0= 0 rem
1 = 0.25 rem
2= 0.5 rem 
3= 1 rem
4= 1.5 rem 
5= 3 rem 

below n means above sizes

1. Extra Large = p-xl-n
2. Large = p-lg-n
