    <div class="test">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Esse, earum quidem! Illo saepe veritatis mollitia modi sequi, quod a dicta!</div>
   <p>aspect ratio used for responsive design because if we give any of the value like here we gave width property for the div.
       if content inside the div will become more then automatically div height will be adjust according to the content.
   </p>
    <p>aspect ratio first value is for width & second value is for height</p>
   <p>we can set any one of the value, but if we give both the value i.e heigh & width in that case aspect ration will not work</p>
   <p>if we don't give height & width property and just give aspect ratio in that case height will became auto because default 
       value of width is auto i.e width of the browser. So height will become width of the browser.
